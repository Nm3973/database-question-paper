            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Keys are fundamental to the structure and integrity of relational databases. They ensure that each record within a table can be uniquely identified and that relationships between tables are properly maintained.</p>

            <h2>Types of Keys</h2>
            <h3>Super Key</h3>
            <p>A super key is a set of one or more columns that can uniquely identify a record in a table. A table can have multiple super keys.</p>

            <h3>Candidate Key</h3>
            <p>A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it contains no unnecessary columns. Each table can have one or more candidate keys.</p>

            <h3>Primary Key</h3>
            <p>A primary key is a candidate key chosen to uniquely identify records in a table. A table can have only one primary key.</p>

            <h3>Alternative Key</h3>
            <p>An alternative key is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key. It can still uniquely identify records within a table.</p>

            <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
            <p>A foreign key is a column or set of columns that establish a relationship between two tables, referencing the primary key in another table.</p>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Student ID (PK)</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Course ID (FK)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>John</td>
                    <td>101</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Jane</td>
                    <td>102</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>Doe</td>
                    <td>103</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
