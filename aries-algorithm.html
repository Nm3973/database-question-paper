            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics) algorithm is a recovery method used in database management systems to ensure data consistency after a failure. View serializability is a criterion for ensuring the correctness of concurrent transactions.</p>

            <h2>ARIES Algorithm</h2>
            <p>ARIES is a comprehensive recovery algorithm that provides a method for logging and recovery in databases. It is used to ensure that a database can be restored to a consistent state after a crash.</p>

            <h2>Steps in ARIES</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Analysis Phase:</strong> Identifies dirty pages and active transactions at the time of the crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Redo Phase:</strong> Reapplies all changes from the log to ensure updates of committed transactions are reflected.</li>
                <li><strong>Undo Phase:</strong> Reverses changes made by uncommitted transactions to restore the database to a consistent state.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>View Serializability</h2>
            <p>View serializability ensures that a schedule can be transformed into a serial schedule by maintaining the same final state and equivalent read and write sequences. It is less strict than conflict serializability but still guarantees the correctness of transactions.</p>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <pre><code>Schedule:
T1: R(A) W(A) R(B) W(B)
T2: R(A) W(A) R(B) W(B)
T1: W(A) R(B) W(B) R(A) W(A) R(B) W(B)
T2: T1 R(A) W(A) R(A) W(A) R(B) W(B) R(A) W(B)
                    
View Serializable:
Yes, if the final state and read/write sequences are equivalent to a serial schedule.</code></pre>
