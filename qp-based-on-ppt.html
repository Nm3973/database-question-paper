                <li>
                    <strong>Key Concepts of OODBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. Key concepts include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Represent real-world entities with unique identities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Define the structure and behavior of objects. They act as blueprints for creating objects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, facilitating code reuse and extension.</li>
                        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing for flexible code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Hides the internal state of objects, exposing only necessary interfaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Define the behavior of objects, similar to functions in procedural programming.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These concepts help in modeling complex data and relationships directly in the database, providing a more intuitive approach for developers familiar with object-oriented programming.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Architecture of Parallel DBMS:</strong>
                    <p>A Parallel DBMS architecture is designed to improve performance by distributing data and processing tasks across multiple processors and storage devices. There are three main types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> All processors access a common memory space, facilitating fast communication but limited by memory contention.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Disk:</strong> Each processor has its own memory but shares a common disk. This setup reduces memory contention but can face bottlenecks at the disk level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Nothing:</strong> Each processor has its own memory and disk, communicating over a network. This architecture scales well and avoids contention but requires efficient data partitioning and communication strategies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The architecture aims to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance by leveraging parallelism in data processing tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Main Differences Between Distributed Databases and Parallel Databases:</strong>
                    <p>Distributed databases and parallel databases differ in their architecture and goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Distributed Databases:</strong> Spread across multiple geographically dispersed locations, connected via a network. Focuses on data distribution and local autonomy. Each site operates independently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parallel Databases:</strong> Utilize multiple processors and storage devices within a single location to process queries simultaneously. Emphasizes performance improvement and scalability through parallel execution.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While distributed databases handle geographically dispersed data, parallel databases optimize query processing by dividing tasks among processors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Query Optimization in Distributed Database Systems:</strong>
                    <p>Query optimization in distributed database systems involves selecting the most efficient execution plan for a query across multiple sites. The process includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Query Decomposition:</strong> Breaking down a high-level query into sub-queries that can be executed at different sites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Localization:</strong> Determining which data fragments are required for each sub-query.</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Optimization:</strong> Selecting the optimal execution plan that minimizes data transfer, balances load, and reduces response time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Techniques like semi-join, join ordering, and data replication are used to enhance performance by reducing data transfer costs and optimizing resource usage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>ARIES Recovery Algorithm:</strong>
                    <p>The ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics) recovery algorithm ensures data consistency and durability after a database crash. It involves three phases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Analysis Phase:</strong> Identifies dirty pages and active transactions by analyzing the log from the last checkpoint to the crash point.</li>
                        <li><strong>Redo Phase:</strong> Reapplies all changes from the log to ensure that all committed transactions are reflected in the database.</li>
                        <li><strong>Undo Phase:</strong> Reverses changes made by uncommitted transactions to restore the database to a consistent state.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ARIES uses a write-ahead logging protocol, ensuring that log records are written before actual data changes, which is crucial for maintaining database integrity and preventing data loss.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Locking:</strong> Mechanisms like two-phase locking (2PL) ensure that multiple transactions do not interfere with each other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Timestamp Ordering:</strong> Assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction, ensuring a serializable schedule.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC):</strong> Maintains multiple versions of data, allowing read and write operations to occur simultaneously without conflicts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These techniques help manage concurrent access, ensuring data consistency and system performance in multimedia databases.</p>
                </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Together, these components enable efficient and consistent data management across multiple locations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Benefits and Challenges of OODBMS over RDBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) offer benefits such as seamless integration with object-oriented programming languages, support for complex data types, and improved modeling of real-world entities. However, they also present challenges like steep learning curves, lack of standardization, and potential performance issues. Traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are well-established, with extensive tool support and standardization (SQL). They excel in handling structured data but may struggle with complex, hierarchical data models.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Fragmentation in Distributed Database Systems:</strong>

It includes details about data location, partitioning schemes, indexes, and query execution plans. Metadata helps optimize query processing, manage data distribution, and ensure efficient resource utilization. It enables the Parallel DBMS to parallelize data operations, balance loads, and achieve high performance and scalability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Significance of CAP Theorem:</strong>
                    <p>The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, states that in a distributed database system, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance (CAP). Consistency ensures all nodes see the same data at the same time. Availability ensures that every request receives a response. Partition tolerance ensures the system continues to operate despite network partitions. The CAP theorem highlights the trade-offs that distributed systems must make, guiding the design and implementation of such systems based on specific requirements.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Key Principles of Distributed Database Design:</strong>
                    <p>Distributed database design principles focus on data distribution, replication, and transparency. Key principles include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Dividing data into smaller pieces for improved performance and manageability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Replication:</strong> Creating copies of data to enhance availability and fault tolerance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> Deciding where data fragments and replicas are stored to optimize performance and resource utilization.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Transparency principles, such as location transparency (users are unaware of data location) and replication transparency (users see a single data copy), ensure a seamless user experience. The goal is to optimize performance, availability, and fault tolerance while maintaining data consistency and integrity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Role of Object Identity in OODBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Object identity is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS). It ensures that each object has a unique identifier, distinguishing it from other objects. Object identity is independent of the object's state or value, allowing objects to be referenced and accessed consistently. This concept enables relationships between objects, supports inheritance, and allows for efficient object retrieval and manipulation. Object identity is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of data in OODBMS.</p>
