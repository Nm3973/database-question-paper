            <ol>
                <li><strong>Key Concepts of OODBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities. Key concepts include objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and methods. Objects represent real-world entities and have unique identities. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects. Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, facilitating code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of objects, exposing only necessary interfaces. Methods define the behavior of objects.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Architecture of Parallel DBMS:</strong>
                    <p>A Parallel DBMS architecture consists of multiple processors and storage devices working together to process database queries. It includes three main types: shared memory, shared disk, and shared nothing. In a shared memory architecture, all processors access a common memory space. In a shared disk architecture, each processor has its own memory but shares a common disk. In a shared nothing architecture, each processor has its own memory and disk, communicating over a network. This architecture aims to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance by parallelizing data processing tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Main Differences Between Distributed Databases and Parallel Databases:</strong>
                    <p>Distributed databases are spread across multiple locations, connected via a network, and managed independently. They focus on data distribution and local autonomy. Parallel databases, on the other hand, use multiple processors and storage devices within a single location to process queries simultaneously. They emphasize performance improvement and scalability through parallel execution. While distributed databases handle geographically dispersed data, parallel databases optimize query processing by dividing tasks among processors.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Query Optimization in Distributed Database Systems:</strong>
                    <p>Query optimization in distributed database systems involves selecting the most efficient execution plan for a query across multiple sites. It includes steps like query decomposition, data localization, and global optimization. The optimizer considers factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource availability. Techniques like semi-join, join ordering, and data replication are used to minimize data transfer and improve query performance. The goal is to reduce response time and resource usage while ensuring correct query results.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>ARIES Recovery Algorithm:</strong>
                    <p>The ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics) recovery algorithm ensures data consistency and durability in database systems after a crash. It involves three phases: analysis, redo, and undo. In the analysis phase, ARIES identifies dirty pages and active transactions. The redo phase reapplies all changes from the log to ensure committed transactions are reflected. The undo phase reverses changes made by uncommitted transactions. ARIES uses a write-ahead logging protocol, ensuring that log records are written before actual data changes. This algorithm is crucial for maintaining database integrity and preventing data loss.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Concurrency Control in Multimedia Databases:</strong>
                    <p>Concurrency control in multimedia databases addresses challenges such as varying data types, real-time requirements, and large data volumes. Techniques include locking, timestamp ordering, and multiversion concurrency control (MVCC). Locking mechanisms, like two-phase locking (2PL), ensure that multiple transactions do not interfere with each other. Timestamp ordering assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction, ensuring a serializable schedule. MVCC maintains multiple versions of data, allowing read and write operations to occur simultaneously without conflicts. These techniques help manage concurrent access, ensuring data consistency and system performance.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Main Components of DDBMS:</strong>
                    <p>A Distributed Database Management System (DDBMS) consists of several components, including the database itself, a network for communication, and various software components for data management. Key components are the data processor, data manager, and transaction manager. The data processor handles query processing and optimization. The data manager manages data storage, retrieval, and updates. The transaction manager ensures ACID properties and coordinates distributed transactions. Together, these components enable efficient and consistent data management across multiple locations.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Benefits and Challenges of OODBMS over RDBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) offer benefits such as seamless integration with object-oriented programming languages, support for complex data types, and improved modeling of real-world entities. However, they also present challenges like steep learning curves, lack of standardization, and potential performance issues. Traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are well-established, with extensive tool support and standardization (SQL). They excel in handling structured data but may struggle with complex, hierarchical data models.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Fragmentation in Distributed Database Systems:</strong>
                    <p>Data fragmentation in distributed database systems involves dividing a database into smaller fragments to improve performance and manageability. Types include horizontal fragmentation, vertical fragmentation, and hybrid fragmentation. Horizontal fragmentation divides tables into subsets of rows based on specific criteria. Vertical fragmentation splits tables into subsets of columns. Hybrid fragmentation combines both horizontal and vertical fragmentation. Proper fragmentation can reduce data transfer costs and enhance query performance by localizing data access.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Role of Metadata in Parallel DBMS:</strong>
                    <p>Metadata in a Parallel Database Management System (Parallel DBMS) provides essential information about the structure, organization, and distribution of data across multiple processors. It includes details about data location, partitioning schemes, indexes, and query execution plans. Metadata helps optimize query processing, manage data distribution, and ensure efficient resource utilization. It enables the Parallel DBMS to parallelize data operations, balance loads, and achieve high performance and scalability.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Significance of CAP Theorem:</strong>
                    <p>The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, states that in a distributed database system, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance (CAP). Consistency ensures all nodes see the same data at the same time. Availability ensures that every request receives a response. Partition tolerance ensures the system continues to operate despite network partitions. The CAP theorem highlights the trade-offs that distributed systems must make, guiding the design and implementation of such systems based on specific requirements.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Storage and Retrieval of Large Multimedia Objects:</strong>
                    <p>Multimedia databases handle large multimedia objects, such as images, audio, and video, using specialized storage techniques. These techniques include object storage, where multimedia files are stored as binary large objects (BLOBs) or character large objects (CLOBs). Indexing methods, like R-trees and quad-trees, help efficiently retrieve multimedia content. Compression techniques reduce storage requirements, while streaming protocols facilitate real-time data access. Multimedia databases also employ metadata to describe and organize multimedia objects, enabling efficient search and retrieval.</p>

                    <p>Query processing in a Parallel Database Management System (Parallel DBMS) involves distributing and executing queries across multiple processors to improve performance. It includes query decomposition, data distribution, and parallel execution. The goal is to minimize response time and maximize resource utilization by leveraging parallelism. Techniques like pipelining, partitioning, and load balancing are used to ensure efficient query execution. Query optimization strategies, such as cost-based optimization, are employed to choose the best execution plan.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Replication in Distributed Databases:</strong>
                    <p>Data replication in distributed databases involves creating copies of data across multiple nodes to improve availability, fault tolerance, and query performance. Techniques include synchronous and asynchronous replication. Synchronous replication ensures that all copies are updated simultaneously, providing strong consistency. Asynchronous replication allows updates to propagate over time, improving performance but risking temporary inconsistencies. Replication strategies, such as master-slave and peer-to-peer, are chosen based on specific requirements and trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases for Multimedia Data:</strong>
                    <p>NoSQL databases offer several advantages for multimedia data, including flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and high performance for read and write operations. They support various data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of multimedia content. However, NoSQL databases may lack the ACID properties of traditional databases, leading to potential consistency issues. They may also require custom query languages and lack standardization, increasing complexity in data management.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Main Features of Object-Relational Databases:</strong>
                    <p>Object-relational databases (ORDBMS) combine features of relational databases and object-oriented databases. They support complex data types, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling the modeling of real-world entities. ORDBMS use SQL for querying and provide mechanisms for integrating user-defined types, functions, and methods. They maintain the benefits of relational databases, such as ACID properties, while offering the flexibility of object-oriented programming. This combination allows for efficient data management and application development.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Two-Phase Commit Protocol:</strong>
                    <p>The two-phase commit (2PC) protocol ensures transaction consistency in distributed databases by coordinating a commit process across multiple nodes. It involves two phases: the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the prepare phase, the coordinator sends a prepare request to all participating nodes, which respond with a vote (commit or abort). If all votes are commit, the coordinator sends a commit request in the commit phase. If any node votes to abort, the coordinator sends an abort request. 2PC guarantees atomicity, ensuring all nodes either commit or abort the transaction.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Techniques for Indexing Multimedia Data:</strong>
                    <p>Indexing multimedia data involves creating data structures that facilitate efficient retrieval of multimedia content. Techniques include spatial indexing (R-trees, quad-trees), content-based indexing (feature extraction, similarity measures), and temporal indexing (time-based retrieval for audio/video). Spatial indexing organizes data based on spatial relationships, enabling fast access to images and geographic data. Content-based indexing uses features like color, texture, and shape for image and video retrieval. Temporal indexing helps manage and retrieve time-based multimedia content, such as video sequences.</p>
