            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Partitioning is a database design technique that improves the management, performance, and availability of data. It involves dividing a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions.</p>

            <h2>Types of Partitioning</h2>
            <h3>Hash Partitioning</h3>
            <p>Hash partitioning involves using a hash function to distribute data across multiple partitions. It ensures an even distribution of data, which helps in load balancing and enhances query performance. Hash partitioning is particularly useful when the distribution of data is unknown or unpredictable.</p>

            <h3>Range Partitioning</h3>
            <p>Range partitioning involves dividing data based on a range of values. Each partition holds data within a specific range. This technique is beneficial when queries often involve a range of values, as it allows for efficient data retrieval.</p>

            <h3>Round-Robin Partitioning</h3>
            <p>Round-robin partitioning distributes data evenly across all partitions in a cyclic manner. It is simple to implement but may not always result in optimal performance, especially if the data access patterns are not uniform.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Hash and Range Partitioning Over Round-Robin Partitioning</h2>
            <p>Hash and range partitioning offer better data distribution and query performance optimization compared to round-robin partitioning. They allow for more predictable and efficient data retrieval, making them suitable for complex and large-scale database systems.</p>
