            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Database middleware is a software layer that sits between client applications and the database. It facilitates communication, query execution, and transaction management, providing a range of services to enhance database operations.</p>

            <h2>Functions of Database Middleware</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Query Routing:</strong> Directs client queries to the appropriate database server, optimizing query execution and load balancing.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Management:</strong> Coordinates transactions across multiple databases, ensuring consistency and integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection Pooling:</strong> Manages a pool of database connections to optimize resource usage and improve performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Converts data between different formats or schemas to ensure compatibility between client applications and databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Provides authentication, authorization, and encryption services to protect data and manage access control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of Database Middleware</h2>
            <p>Database middleware enhances scalability, performance, and reliability of database systems. It simplifies the development of distributed applications, provides a unified interface for multiple databases, and supports advanced features such as caching and replication.</p>
