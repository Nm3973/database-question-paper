            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Accessing SQL from programming languages involves integrating SQL queries into the application code. This process can present several challenges related to performance, error handling, security, and more.</p>

            <h2>Common Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Impedance Mismatch</h3>
            <p>The difference in data models between SQL (relational) and programming languages (object-oriented) creates complexity in data translation and manipulation.</p>

            <h3>Error Handling</h3>
            <p>Properly catching and managing SQL errors within application code is crucial to ensure robust and reliable applications.</p>

            <h3>Query Optimization</h3>
            <p>Writing efficient SQL queries to avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure fast data retrieval can be challenging, especially for complex queries.</p>

            <h3>Security Concerns</h3>
            <p>Protecting against SQL injection attacks and ensuring secure database access are critical considerations when integrating SQL with application code.</p>

            <h3>Connection Management</h3>
            <p>Efficiently managing database connections to ensure application performance and avoid resource exhaustion is essential, particularly in high-load scenarios.</p>

            <h3>Concurrency Control</h3>
            <p>Handling concurrent data access to avoid deadlocks and ensure data consistency can be complex in multi-user environments.</p>

            <h3>Transaction Management</h3>
            <p>Ensuring ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for transactions requires careful handling in application code.</p>

            <h3>Schema Evolution</h3>
            <p>Adapting application code to changes in the database schema, such as adding or removing columns, can introduce additional complexity.</p>
