            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Fragmentation in a database refers to dividing a database into smaller pieces called fragments, which can be managed and accessed separately. A lossless-join ensures that these fragments can be recombined to reconstruct the original database without losing any data.</p>

            <h2>Types of Fragmentation</h2>
            <h3>Horizontal Fragmentation</h3>
            <p>Horizontal fragmentation divides a table into subsets of rows, each subset being a fragment. This is typically based on a condition applied to the rows.</p>

            <h3>Vertical Fragmentation</h3>
            <p>Vertical fragmentation divides a table into subsets of columns, each subset being a fragment. This is usually done to group columns that are
